It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [MIT](LICENSE).



We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn/releases).


### Basic Example
Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:
```hcl
      module "s3_bucket" {
        source         = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-s3.git"

        name           = "secure-bucket-cdn"
        region         = "us-east-1"
        application    = "clouddrove"
        environment    = "test"
        label_order    = ["environment", "name", "application"]

        versioning     = true
        acl            = "private"
        bucket_enabled = true
      }

      module "acm" {
        source               = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-acm.git"

        name                 = "certificate"
        application          = "clouddrove"
        environment          = "test"
        label_order          = ["environment", "name", "application"]

        domain_name          = "clouddrove.com"
        validation_method    = "EMAIL"
        validate_certificate = false
      }

      module "cdn" {
        source = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn.git"

        name        = "basic-cdn"
        application = "clouddrove"
        label_order = ["environment", "name", "application"]

        environment            = "test"
        aliases                = ["clouddrove.com"]
        bucket_name            = module.s3_bucket.s3_default_id[0]
        viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
        compress               = "false"
        allowed_methods        = ["GET", "HEAD"]
        acm_certificate_arn    = module.acm.arn[0]
      }
