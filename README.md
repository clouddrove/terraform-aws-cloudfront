We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cloudfront-cdn/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### CDN With Basic Bucket
```hcl
      module "cdn" {
        source                 = "clouddrove/cloudfront-cdn/aws"
        version                = "1.0.1"
        name                   = "basic-cdn"
        environment            = "test"
        label_order            = ["name", "environment"]
        enabled_bucket         = true
        compress               = false
        aliases                = ["clouddrove.com"]
        bucket_name            = "test-bucket"
        viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
        allowed_methods        = ["GET", "HEAD"]
        acm_certificate_arn    = "arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:certificate/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx"
      }
```

### CDN With Secure Bucket
```hcl
      module "cdn" {
        source                 = "clouddrove/cloudfront-cdn/aws"
        version                = "1.0.1"
        name                   = "secure-cdn"
        environment            = "test"
        label_order            = ["name", "environment"]
        aliases                = ["clouddrove.com"]
        bucket_name            = "test-bucket"
        viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
        compress               = false
        allowed_methods        = ["GET", "HEAD"]
        acm_certificate_arn    = "arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:certificate/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx"
        trusted_signers        = ["self"]
        public_key_enable      = true
        public_key             = "./../cdn.pem"
      }
```
### CDN With Domain
```hcl
    module "cdn" {
      source                 = "clouddrove/cloudfront-cdn/aws"
      version                = "1.0.1"
      name                   = "domain-cdn"
      environment            = "test"
      label_order            = ["name", "environment"]
      custom_domain          = true
      compress               = false
      aliases                = ["clouddrove.com"]
      domain_name            = "clouddrove.com"
      viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
      allowed_methods        = ["GET", "HEAD"]
      acm_certificate_arn    = "arn:aws:acm:eu-west-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:certificate/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx"
     }
```

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
